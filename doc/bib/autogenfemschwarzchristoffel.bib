abstract = {This paper describes a particular conformal mapping, the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. A practical method for evaluating the parameters defining this transformation is described and two such transformations are used to construct a mapping between any two polygons. The desirable properties of a finite element mesh are stated and a method is described which attempts to generate such a mesh in any simply-connected region, using conformal mappings. This computer method is non-interactive and attempts to produce a good mesh with the minimum of input data. Some examples are included.}
