abstract = {This paper treats conformal mapping as it relates to the generation of grids to be used for flow simulation. Classical and contemporary mapping methods are discussed and compared in some detail. Numerous suggestions are included to help the reader avoid common pitfalls, and the mapping methods believed most promising are identified.}
