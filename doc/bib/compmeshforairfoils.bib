abstract="The standard mesh that we propose for Problems A, C, D, and G may be generated by the program described here in conjunction with the accompanying data cards. It is a curvilinear body-fitted type system produced by direct geometrical construction, where normally the body coincides with the first mesh line. Provision was made, however, to locate the body half way between the first two mesh lines in order to accommodate those methods which require it.",
