\subsection{Workarounds of Common Problems}
Finally, we discuss some known workarounds for common problems in conformal mapping algorithms.

\subsubsection{Osculation Methods}\label{chap:OsculationMethods}
Osculation methods are preliminary conformal maps that smooth the boundary curve $\Gamma$ of the domain $\Omega$ before applying a more accurate conformal mapping algorithm such as Theodorsen's method. 

\subsubsection{Crowding}\label{chap:crowding}
