table of comparison OAP/ newton-wegmann? or prosa enough

check symm first kind but in chapter for second kind? toc

WHAT FORMAT DOES THE MESH HAVE I WILL BE GIVEN


check finite element mesh arvix

differentiability of zipper method construction? sollte gehen
jacobi of zipper using back propagation?

während dem coden tests schreiben

check all methods are present in overview flowchart
add section numbers

put in each method's description what exactly it gets its restriction from, e.g. pinpoint the bottleneck

future work: maybe mention more niche methods which were not covered for time reasons

done:
x note in the beginning thaty R²=C

a deformation psi von x,y klar angeben= u + iv such that Jpsi = 0.
As a byproduct of the Cauchy-Riemann equ
psi(z)=psi(x,y) klar machen z komplex, x,y reell   

eq 3 u = Re(eta) nicht re(psi)=eta

This problem has a unique solution up to an imaginary constant falsch: realteil eindeutig, imaginärteil wird dann hergeleitet und ist bis auf const auch eondeutig

definition 8 falsch g sollte phi sein
