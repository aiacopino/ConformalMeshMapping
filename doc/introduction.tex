\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
The mathematics curriculum at ETHZ is renowned for its rigorous foundation in theoretical principles. This emphasis builds a robust understanding of foundational theory, but often at the expense of practical computational skills. As a result, students may find themselves well-versed in abstract concepts yet less prepared to tackle real-world problems that require numerical methods and algorithmic implementations. This thesis serves as a deliberate effort to bridge that gap. My personal gap. The project's primary motivation is to connect a core area of theoretical mathematics—conformal mapping—with its computational implementation. By implementing and conducting a comparative analysis of various numerical methods, this work aims to explore the practical challenges and solutions that arise when translating abstract mathematical concepts into tangible, applied results.
