\begin{abstract}
    When performing shape optimization one encounters the problem of conformal mapping of a relatively simple onto a potentially very complicated domain. The Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of such a conformal map, but does not provide any explicit construction of it. In practice, one has to resort to numerical methods to construct the conformal map.
    This text is intended to give a general overview of currently known numerical algorithms for this very problem, and to provide a comparison of their suitability in terms of input and output format as well as their performance in terms of accuracy and speed.
    One of the algorithms is then implemented in the context of a 2-dimensional shape optimization problem, and its performance is evaluated.


    % If the region S is a convex polygon, the extremal problem can be treated numerically by linear programming methods (Opfer [202]).
