  We present a randomized algorithm for selecting the median of an unsorted array in \Oh*{n} time with high probability. Unlike classical deterministic methods---notably the median-of-medians algorithm---our approach leverages random sampling to simplify the pivot-selection process and reduce overhead. Specifically, we extract a sublinear sample of the input, sort this sample, and employ its near-median elements as pivots. By bounding \Prob{\abs{X - \E{X}} \ge k} for appropriate choices of \(X\) and \(k\), we ensure that the size of the sub-array requiring a full sort remains sufficiently small.
  A rigorous analysis, based on Chebyshev’s inequality, demonstrates that the algorithm’s probability of “failure” (i.e., incorrectly bracketed pivots) decays quickly with the input size. In successful executions, the asymptotic cost of sorting the sample and the sub-array is dominated by a single pass through the input, yielding an overall running time of \Oh*{n}. While deterministic linear-time solutions to selection exist, our randomized method offers competitive performance in practice, owing to its simplicity and favorable hidden constants. We also discuss how this technique can be combined with deterministic strategies to eliminate worst-case risk.
